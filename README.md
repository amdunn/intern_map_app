intern_map_app
==============

This is the main app of the intern map project.  It's a Flask-based
simple web app to distribute the main code of this project to
authorized sources.

You need to instantiate this with the intern group number, a Bing maps
API key, and with a data file from the screen scraping portion of this
project (intern_map repository).
